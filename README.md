# sfrun
Run any .exe on Service Fabric like a hero

## Usage

```
sfrun web.exe
```

## Next step

 * make it cross platfrom, move to dotnet core. (running on net46 is due to SF SDK)
 * package version generator is modified time based, this might not work if you add an older file or delete some files.
 * security cluster support
